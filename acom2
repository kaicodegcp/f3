Description

Unblocking Cloudera Data Services (CDS) Deployment Path for CDE/CDW Enablement:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team collaborated with Cloudera engineering to troubleshoot and resolve a critical environment failure that had blocked CDS installation and service enablement for over a week. The root cause was traced to missing and misconfigured Kubernetes service account credentials and TLS artifacts required for CDE/CDW environment creation.

To resolve the issue, a compliant and cluster-ready kube_config.yaml file was created, containing the necessary service account bindings, tokens, and certificate references. This config file now enables successful creation of CDS environments and smooth progression with CDE/CDW testing and validation.

Key Achievements:

Coordinated with Cloudera support to isolate the environment setup issue impacting CDS deployment.

Generated and validated kube_config.yaml with proper context, service account token, and TLS certs.

Unblocked CDS environment provisioning on OpenShift, including CDE and CDW workloads.

Successfully tested environment creation using the updated kubeconfig setup.

Benefits to the Team:

Unblocks critical CDS service onboarding, including Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) and Data Warehouse (CDW).

Establishes a reusable kubeconfig template for all future environment setups.

Avoids manual Kubernetes setup steps during CDS install workflows.

Ensures compliance with Citiâ€™s access control and TLS security policies during CDS onboarding.

Next Steps:

Store the validated kube_config.yaml securely for reuse across lower and upper SDLC environments.

Automate the generation process of kubeconfig using service account creation scripts.

Resume end-to-end CDE/CDW deployment and integration testing.
