Accelerating EAP Host Reusability through Safe Data Volume Cleanup:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team completed development of a DataNode cleanup automation that safely wipes data volume groups (datavg) for both HDFS and Ozone host types. The Ansible-based solution enables administrators to perform a dry-run validation prior to destructive wipe operations, ensuring data integrity and full transparency before executing the final cleanup.

This automation addresses the operational gap in securely repurposing existing hosts or preparing them for new assignments without Unix SA dependency.

Key Achievements:

Developed a dynamic Ansible playbook capable of identifying and wiping datavg on any HDFS or Ozone host.

Implemented dual-mode execution:

Dry-run mode generates a report of volumes that would be wiped.

WIPE mode performs the actual cleanup after validation.

Integrated user-driven execution from the Starfleet portal with email reports for each run.

Tested successfully across both legacy and new EAP-managed server types.

Benefits to the Team:

Empowers faster host recycling without relying on external Unix SA teams.

Ensures data safety by requiring dry-run review before actual cleanup.

Reduces errors by enforcing automation and eliminating manual steps.

Supports clean handoff for hardware refresh, lab rebuilds, and cluster expansion.

Next Steps:

Extend automation to include automatic /data/1–10 mount recreation post-cleanup.

Add host-type awareness for validation logic and targeted cleanup.

Promote the playbook to UAT and PROD environments post DEV validation.

Let me know if you’d like a combined report for multiple automation projects this week or keep them tracked separately for clarity.

Here’s your final weekly accomplishment entry (for the week ending September 5, 2025) regarding the datavg rebuild automation for Ozone DataNodes:

Title

Automated Rebuild of Data Volume Mounts for Ozone DataNodes (/data/1–10)

Submitted for Week Ending

9/5/2025

Description

Standardizing Ozone Host Disk Layout through Automation:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully developed and implemented an Ansible automation script to rebuild the datavg volume group with 10 standardized mount points (/data/1 to /data/10) on Ozone DataNode host types. This automation was crucial to the completion of the Ozone hardware refresh and significantly reduced manual effort in preparing new or cleaned-up servers for production use.

Key Achievements:

Created an Ansible playbook to wipe, recreate, and format datavg into 10 evenly sized logical volumes.

Standardized the mount structure (/data/1 to /data/10) as required by Ozone DataNode service layout.

Implemented fstab updates with mount tagging for persistence and clarity (e.g., ansible:ozone-managed).

Validated across newly provisioned hosts and cleaned-up legacy servers as part of hardware onboarding.

Benefits to the Team:

Saves time and manual intervention during Ozone DataNode provisioning.

Ensures consistent disk layout aligned with Cloudera deployment best practices.

Reduces onboarding time for hardware transitions and cluster expansion.

Minimizes configuration drift by applying infrastructure-as-code methodology.

Next Steps:

Combine with cleanup automation for full end-to-end server repurposing.

Extend support for dynamic disk sizing and RAID configurations.

Promote automation across SDLC environments (DEV → UAT → PROD).
