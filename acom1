Description

Strengthening Platform Stability with Automated Python Setup:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team completed an enhancement to the existing Python installation automation by developing a unified Ansible playbook that detects the host OS version (RHEL7 or RHEL8) and performs automated installation and softlink repair for both python and python3.

This update was critical in addressing VTM patch-related breakages on EAP-managed infrastructure where python and python3 softlinks were often misconfigured post-patching. The improved playbook eliminates the need for user-supplied parameters and ensures the correct packages and links are restored based on OS detection logic.

Key Achievements:

Implemented OS detection logic to auto-select compatible Python package sets for RHEL7 and RHEL8.

Fixed broken softlinks (/usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python3) by dynamically validating and recreating them.

Deployed and validated playbook in PROD region, making it available for immediate operational use.

Supported seamless recovery during post-VTM patch validation for EAP operations.

Benefits to the Team:

Reduces operational downtime and manual intervention caused by Python softlink issues.

Ensures consistent behavior across mixed RHEL environments without requiring user input.

Provides ready-to-run automation for common platform issues during patching cycles.

Aligns with Citiâ€™s automation-first approach for base OS recoverability.

Next Steps:

Add integrated email reporting of fix actions and versions installed.

Expand playbook to optionally install pip and Python virtualenv modules.

Publish the enhanced playbook as part of standard EAP OS recovery toolkit.
